# Vega Chess Results — Publishing Guide

Welcome! This page explains how to publish your tournament data generated by Vega to this site.

## Prerequisites
- Vega pairing software installed on your machine
- Access to the upload endpoint (FTP/SFTP) configured for this project
- Your tournament folder naming convention: `wwwYYYYTournamentName` (example: `www2025BestintheWest`)

## Step 1 — Export tournament pages from Vega
1. In Vega, generate the standard web output (PHP/HTML files)
2. Ensure at minimum these pages exist in your output:
   - `index.php` and/or `index.html`
   - `standings.php` / `standings.html`
   - Optional: `pairs1.php`, `crosstable.php`, `tourstat.php`, etc.

Tip: If your output is PHP only, our pipeline automatically requests each PHP page and writes matching `.html` files.

## Step 2 — Prepare your folder
- Place all generated files in a single folder named like `www2025YourTournament`
- Do not zip; the sync process will detect and process the folder

## Step 3 — Upload (FTP)
- Connect to the provided FTP endpoint
- Upload your entire `www*` folder into the remote path monitored by the system
- Only upload changed files to speed up processing

The server will: fetch changes → mirror into the repo `vega/www*` → generate in-place HTML (if needed) → convert to JSON → upsert to the database → publish `www/data/www*.json` for the web app.

## What gets published
- No HTML is published to the site anymore
- A single JSON file per tournament is published under `/data/` with name: `www<FolderName>.json`
  - Example: `/data/www2025BestintheWest.json`

## Verifying your data
- After upload, wait for the “Main Sync Workflow” to finish (GitHub Actions)
- Visit the app and open your tournament page:
  - URL pattern: `/<FolderName>` (example: `/2025BestintheWest`)
  - The app fetches data from `/data/www<FolderName>.json`

## Troubleshooting
- If your folder has only `.php` files, that’s fine — HTML will be generated automatically
- Ensure `index.html` or `standings.html` exists after generation; they are used to build menus
- If your event name or folder changed, the published filename also changes accordingly
- For issues, check the GitHub Actions logs of “Main Sync Workflow”
